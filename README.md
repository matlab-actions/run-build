# Action for Running MATLAB Builds

Starting in R2022b, the MATLAB&reg; build tool provides a standard programming interface to create and run software-build tasks in a uniform and efficient way. For example, you can create tasks that identify code issues, run tests, and package a toolbox in a single build file in your project root folder, and then invoke the build tool to run these tasks. For more information, see [Overview of MATLAB Build Tool](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/overview-of-matlab-build-tool.html).

The [Run MATLAB Build](#run-matlab-build) action enables you to invoke the MATLAB build tool on a [self-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) or [GitHub&reg;-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners) runner:

- To use a self-hosted runner, you must set up a computer with MATLAB as your runner. The runner uses the topmost MATLAB version on the system path to execute your workflow.

- To use a GitHub-hosted runner, you must include the [Setup MATLAB](https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab/) action in your workflow to set up MATLAB on the runner. Currently, this action is available only for public projects. It does not set up transformation products, such as MATLAB Coder&trade; and MATLAB Compiler&trade;.

## Examples
Use the **Run MATLAB Build** action to run builds using the MATLAB build tool. You can use this action to run the tasks in the plan returned by a file named  `buildfile.m` in the root of your repository.

### Run MATLAB Build on Self-Hosted Runner
Use a self-hosted runner to run the default tasks in your build plan as well as all the tasks on which they depend.

```yaml
name: Run MATLAB Build on Self-Hosted Runner
on: [push]
jobs:
  my-job:
    name: Run MATLAB Build
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run build
        uses: matlab-actions/run-build@v1
```

### Run MATLAB Build on GitHub-Hosted Runner
Before you run MATLAB code or Simulink models on a GitHub-hosted runner, first use the [Setup MATLAB](https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab/) action. The action sets up your specified MATLAB release (R2020a or later) on a Linux&reg; virtual machine. If you do not specify a release, the action sets up the latest release of MATLAB. To use the **Run MATLAB Build** action, you need MATLAB R2022b or a later release.

For example, set up the latest release of MATLAB on a GitHub-hosted runner, and then use the **Run MATLAB Build** action to run a specific task and its depended-on tasks.

```yaml
name: Run MATLAB Build on GitHub-Hosted Runner
on: [push]
jobs:
  my-job:
    name: Run MATLAB Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up MATLAB
        uses: matlab-actions/setup-matlab@v1
      - name: Run build
        uses: matlab-actions/run-build@v1
        with:
          tasks: test
```

## Run MATLAB Build
When you define your workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository, specify the **Run MATLAB Build** action as `matlab-actions/run-build@v1`. The action accepts an optional input.

Input                     | Description
------------------------- | ---------------
`tasks`                   | (Optional) Space-separated list of tasks to run. If not specified, the action runs the default tasks in the plan returned by `buildfile.m` as well as all the tasks on which they depend.</br>**Example:** `test`</br>**Example:** `compile test`

MATLAB exits with exit code 0 if the tasks run without error. Otherwise, MATLAB terminates with a nonzero exit code, which causes the workflow to fail.

When you use this action, a file named `buildfile.m` must be in the project root directory. 

## Notes
* The **Run MATLAB Build** action uses the `-batch` option to invoke the [`buildtool`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/buildtool.html) command noninteractively. Preferences do not persist across different MATLAB sessions launched with the `-batch` option. To run code that requires the same preferences, use a single action.

* When you use the **Run MATLAB Build** action, you execute third-party code that is licensed under separate terms.
